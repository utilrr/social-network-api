# social-network-api

## Description of Project
The goal here was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list using a NoSQL database allowing the app can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Aims/Goals
1. Given a social network API when I enter the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
2. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
3. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia I can successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
4. When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia I can create and delete reactions to thoughts and add or remove friends to a user’s friend list.

## Technologies Used
Express.s, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, JavaScript

## Challenges Faced
Time management, getting behind and trying to make up lost ground quickly, has been my biggest challenge in the boot camp. Therefore this task is incomplete. Also, trouble shooting my routes. It seems they don't work exactly as I planned.
